# ACNH_crossing_combo
Given all genotypes you have, list all crossing output from all possible pairs

## Usage:  
In line 9, edit the **ftype**="tulips" to the type of flower  
In line 10, edit the **had**=[] to all the flower genotypes you have (See below)  
Then run `python ACNH_flower_crossing_combo.py`

Flower genotypes credit to https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11pRCX8G0xGizSYWgVhoUSu7pE-MV7AOprBcgSY1whB4/htmlview?usp=sharing#  
However, make the flowing changes for input:  
For **windflowers**, replace **"Oo"** in this google form with **"Yy"**  
For **tulips, lilies and cosmos**, replace **"Ss"** with **"Ww"**.  
Basically, you should have RYW for every flower excpet roses.

## Output:  
The script will generate a html file in the same directory named "ACNH_crossing_result.html".
